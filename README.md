1. Augment your training data [![Foo](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bonetrade/one-shot-learning/blob/master/augmenting_images_for_dataset.ipynb)
2. Train a siamese network, test on new images [![Foo](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bonetrade/one-shot-learning/blob/master/human_remains_one_shot_learning.ipynb)

The Siamese Network notebook is a slightly modified version of Harshvardhan Gupta's [Facial Similarity with Siamese Networks in Pytorch](https://github.com/harveyslash/Facial-Similarity-with-Siamese-Networks-in-Pytorch/blob/master/Siamese-networks-medium.ipynb).
